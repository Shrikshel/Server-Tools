## Configuration

`st` can be configured via a config file. By default, it looks for `$HOME/.config/.st.conf`. You can override this by setting the `ST_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

To edit the config file with nano:

```bash
nano $HOME/.config/.st.conf
```

Or, if you use a custom config location:

```bash
nano "$ST_CONFIG_FILE"
```

Example config:
```bash
# $HOME/.config/.st.conf
NO_COLOR=1  # Disable colored output
```

---

## Requirements

- Ubuntu (or other Debian-based Linux)
- Bash 4+
- `sudo` privileges for package management

---

## Why use st?

- **Saves time**: One command for many routine server tasks
- **Reduces errors**: Consistent, tested scripts
- **Great for headless servers**: No GUI required
- **Easy to extend**: Add your own commands via Bashly
